# S3-IndividualProject
Repository for the semester 4 individual track.

This project is a game website that has a React based frontend, and Java Springboot based backend.

The website is made up of functional React components, which communicate with the backend API by sending and receiving HTTP requests.
The backend is made in Java using Springboot.
It uses a H2 in-memory database for data storage.
Sonarqube is used to validate code quality.
A gitlab runner builds and tests the code with each push for the backend, while Cypress tests the frontend application. 

The project is my introduction to a lot of software development concepts and tools.
